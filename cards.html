		<h1>Virtuoso: F/W 2017</h1>
		<p class="deck_one">
			'The best deck for cardistry is the one designed for it'.
            <br><br>
            One simply cannot argue with this statement of Singaporean team of cardists, named Virtuoso. Their updated Virtuoso: F/W 17 cards could not only boast with great handling and durability, but will also improve the look of your card flourishes. Regardless if you're a beginner or a professional, Virtuoso Fall/Winter 2017 will help you improve. This edition hints at a homage to their very first Virtuoso Launch Edition with its black and forest green (opposite of red) colorway choice for the back design. А polygonal shapes trend wasn't ignored also. 
            <br><br>
            Minimalist design and adaptive aesthetics concept are kept in Virtuoso Fall Winter 2017 deck. Though, following the borderless back design move, faces now feature elements, which make ribbon spreads, fans and other manipulations more visual as well. Even in comparison with a previous innovative Virtuoso: S/S 2016, additional touches for the faces brought in a significantly refreshing feel.

		<h1>Cardistry Touch</h1>
		<p class="deck_two">
			After unprecedented success - 30,000 sold decks of Cardistry Touch: Origin - French cardists Dimitri and Ladislas have released the second edition: Pulse.
            <br><br>
            There's not that many differences compared to a previous edition: a new back design and updated finish from Belgium-based Cartamundi factory. However the well-received tuck case, along with the identical face design and thin white borders on the backs - all remained the same. Just like the previous edition these cards were created for cardistry. Soft right out of the box, but snappy enough for the majority of traditional flourishes. Available in limited quantities in our shop.

            <h1>NoMad</h1>

            <p class="deck_three">
                This unusual deck of playing cards pays its homage to a historic location and a world-renown hotel in New York called the NoMad. It's at this famous place back in 19th century the world's elite spent their leisure time: from Oscar Wilde to Charles Dickens, from Mark Twain to Nikola Tesla.
                <br><br>
                These playing cards are a symbiosis of beauty and elegance, which is beyond time. And here's why. NoMad deck by theory11 perpetuated some of the finest architecture detail of the hotel: from the fireplace on the lower level to the hotel's signature phrase "Made nice". If rotated laterally, the back design reveals an eye-shaped pattern hinting to a Latin saying "Beauty is in the eye of the beholder", which can also be seen on top and bottom of each card. Not a single detail was spared for the tuck case, made of black foiled paper. The exterior of the box features gold embossing and there's intricate illustration on the inside as well.
